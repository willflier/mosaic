# Change log

## [Unreleased]


## [0.4.0] - 2023-02-19

 - Mosaic is now multiplatform!

   The following targets are now supported in addition to the JVM:
     - Linux (X64)
     - MacOS (ARM & X64)
     - Windows (X64)
     - JS (experimental)

   Additionally, the JetBrains Compose compiler is now used instead of AndroidX which
   should offer better support for native and JS targets.

 - `runMosaic` is now a suspending function which will return when the composition ends.
   For the previous behavior, a `runMosaicBlocking` function is provided (JVM + native).


## [0.3.0] - 2023-01-17

 - Support Kotlin 1.8.0 via Compose compiler 1.4.0.
 - New: `Static` composable for rendering permanent output.
 - Fix: Correct line calculation to prevent output from drifting downward over time when its height changes.


## [0.2.0] - 2022-08-12

 - Support Kotlin 1.7.10 via Compose compiler 1.3.0.
 - Migrate from custom build of Compose compiler and Compose runtime to Google's Compose compiler and JetBrains' multiplatform Compose runtime. Note that this will require you have the Google Maven repositories in your Gradle repositories (`google()`).


## [0.1.0] - 2021-06-25
